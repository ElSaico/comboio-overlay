This is the overlay for my Twitch channel, [Comboio do Saico](http://twitch.tv/ElSaico). It's powered by [NodeCG](http://github.com/nodecg/nodecg), which is powerful and flexible enough for things like:

* Seamless integration with Twitch APIs, bypassing the need for platforms such as Streamlabs
* Full configurability - as easy as editing a JSON, plus some knobs and switches added for changing stuff inside OBS itself
* Data persistence (this is how I keep count of how many of my bad puns/jokes were called out so far)
* As much bells and whistles as JavaScript allows, such as [my LED panels](https://github.com/ElSaico/comboio-overlay/blob/master/graphics/led.js) (whose code *really* needs to get spun off as an independent library)
